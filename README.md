# OpenWeatherCT

1. I have used MVVM as a design pattern with Protocol Oriented Programming that makes more efficient ways to  maintain the code and enhancing the reusability.
2. I have also used singleton pattern for the Network manager class to maintain one instantiation of the class
3. I didn't use any third party libraries as Swift providing the more flexible for Networking and Parsing the data using URLSession and Codable protocol.
4. The code is completely unit testable and we can improve the code coverage testing the viewmodels.
